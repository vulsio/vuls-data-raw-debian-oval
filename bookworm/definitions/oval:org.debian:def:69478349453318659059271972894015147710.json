		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  spi: Fix null dereference on suspend  A race condition exists where a synchronous (noqueue) transfer can be active during a system suspend. This can cause a null pointer dereference exception to occur when the system resumes.  Example order of events leading to the exception: 1. spi_sync() calls __spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets    ctlr->cur_msg 2. Spi transfer begins via spi_transfer_one_message() 3. System is suspended interrupting the transfer context 4. System is resumed 6. spi_controller_resume() calls spi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg    to NULL 7. Spi transfer context resumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is    called which dereferences cur_msg (which is now NULL)  Wait for synchronous transfers to complete before suspending by acquiring the bus mutex and setting/checking a suspend flag.",
