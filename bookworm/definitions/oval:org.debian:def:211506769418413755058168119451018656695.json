		"description": "A vulnerability was found in the PCS project. This issue occurs due to incorrect permissions on a Unix socket used for internal communication between PCS daemons. A privilege escalation could happen by obtaining an authentication token for a hacluster user. With the \"hacluster\" token, this flaw allows an attacker to have complete control over the cluster managed by PCS.",
