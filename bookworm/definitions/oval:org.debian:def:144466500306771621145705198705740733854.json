		"description": "The eBPF RINGBUF bpf_ringbuf_reserve() function in the Linux kernel did not check that the allocated size was smaller than the ringbuf size, allowing an attacker to perform out-of-bounds writes within the kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit 4b81ccebaeee (\"bpf, ringbuf: Deny reserve of buffers larger than ringbuf\") (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced via 457f44363a88 (\"bpf: Implement BPF ring buffer and verifier support for it\") (v5.8-rc1).",
