		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fork: defer linking file vma until vma is fully initialized  Thorvald reported a WARNING [1].

Fix this by deferring linking file vma until vma is fully initialized.  Those vmas should be initialized first before they can be used.",
