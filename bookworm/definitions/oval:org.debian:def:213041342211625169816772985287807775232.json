		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: pciehp: Fix infinite loop in IRQ handler upon power fault  The Power Fault Detected bit in the Slot Status register differs from all other hotplug events in that it is sticky:  It can only be cleared after turning off slot power.  Per PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.7.1.8:    If a power controller detects a main power fault on the hot-plug slot,   it must automatically set its internal main power fault latch [...].   The main power fault latch is cleared when software turns off power to   the hot-plug slot.  The stickiness used to cause interrupt storms and infinite loops which were fixed in 2009 by commits 5651c48cfafe (\"PCI pciehp: fix power fault interrupt storm problem\") and 99f0169c17f3 (\"PCI: pciehp: enable software notification on empty slots\").  Unfortunately in 2020 the infinite loop issue was inadvertently reintroduced by commit 8edf5332c393 (\"PCI: pciehp: Fix MSI interrupt race\"):  The hardirq handler pciehp_isr() clears the PFD bit until pciehp's power_fault_detected flag is set.  That happens in the IRQ thread pciehp_ist(), which never learns of the event because the hardirq handler is stuck in an infinite loop.  Fix by setting the power_fault_detected flag already in the hardirq handler.",
