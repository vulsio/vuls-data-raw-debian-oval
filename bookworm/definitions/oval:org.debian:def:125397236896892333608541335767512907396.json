		"description": "Previously Firefox for macOS and Linux would download temporary files to a user-specific directory in <code>/tmp</code>, but this behavior was changed to download them to <code>/tmp</code> where they could be affected by other local users. This behavior was reverted to the original, user-specific directory. <br>*This bug only affects Firefox for macOS and Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 91.7 and Thunderbird < 91.7.",
