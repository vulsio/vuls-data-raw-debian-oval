		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  block, bfq: fix uaf for accessing waker_bfqq after splitting  After commit 42c306ed7233 (\"block, bfq: don't break merge chain in bfq_split_bfqq()\"), if the current procress is the last holder of bfqq, the bfqq can be freed after bfq_split_bfqq(). Hence recored the bfqq and then access bfqq->waker_bfqq may trigger UAF. What's more, the waker_bfqq may in the merge chain of bfqq, hence just recored waker_bfqq is still not safe.  Fix the problem by adding a helper bfq_waker_bfqq() to check if bfqq->waker_bfqq is in the merge chain, and current procress is the only holder.",
