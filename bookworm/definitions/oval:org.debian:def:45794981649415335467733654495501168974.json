		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: prevent pt_regs corruption for secondary idle threads  Top of the kernel thread stack should be reserved for pt_regs. However this is not the case for the idle threads of the secondary boot harts. Their stacks overlap with their pt_regs, so both may get corrupted.  Similar issue has been fixed for the primary hart, see c7cdd96eca28 (\"riscv: prevent stack corruption by reserving task_pt_regs(p) early\"). However that fix was not propagated to the secondary harts. The problem has been noticed in some CPU hotplug tests with V enabled. The function smp_callin stored several registers on stack, corrupting top of pt_regs structure including status field. As a result, kernel attempted to save or restore inexistent V context.",
