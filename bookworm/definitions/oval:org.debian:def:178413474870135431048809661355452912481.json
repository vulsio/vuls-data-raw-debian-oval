		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first  Setting TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED in the end of tpm_pm_suspend() can be racy according, as this leaves window for tpm_hwrng_read() to be called while the operation is in progress. The recent bug report gives also evidence of this behaviour.  Aadress this by locking the TPM chip before checking any chip->flags both in tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_hwrng_read(). Move TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED check inside tpm_get_random() so that it will be always checked only when the lock is reserved.",
