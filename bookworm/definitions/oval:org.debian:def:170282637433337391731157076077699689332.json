		"description": "A heap-based buffer overflow was found in QEMU through 5.0.0 in the SDHCI device emulation support. It could occur while doing a multi block SDMA transfer via the sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() routine in hw/sd/sdhci.c. A guest user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process on the host.",
