		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  jfs: fix array-index-out-of-bounds in dbFindLeaf  Currently while searching for dmtree_t for sufficient free blocks there is an array out of bounds while getting element in tp->dm_stree. To add the required check for out of bound we first need to determine the type of dmtree. Thus added an extra parameter to dbFindLeaf so that the type of tree can be determined and the required check can be applied.",
