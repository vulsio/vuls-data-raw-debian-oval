		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wireguard: netlink: access device through ctx instead of peer  The previous commit fixed a bug that led to a NULL peer->device being dereferenced. It's actually easier and faster performance-wise to instead get the device from ctx->wg. This semantically makes more sense too, since ctx->wg->peer_allowedips.seq is compared with ctx->allowedips_seq, basing them both in ctx. This also acts as a defence in depth provision against freed peers.",
