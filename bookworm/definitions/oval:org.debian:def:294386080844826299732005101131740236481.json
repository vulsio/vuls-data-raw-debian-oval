		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_touch_buffer tracepoint  Patch series \"nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref bugs on block tracepoints\".  This series fixes null pointer dereference bugs that occur when using nilfs2 and two block-related tracepoints.   This patch (of 2):  It has been reported that when using \"block:block_touch_buffer\" tracepoint, touch_buffer() called from __nilfs_get_folio_block() causes a NULL pointer dereference, or a general protection fault when KASAN is enabled.  This happens because since the tracepoint was added in touch_buffer(), it references the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev regardless of whether the buffer head has a pointer to a block_device structure.  In the current implementation, the block_device structure is set after the function returns to the caller.  Here, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer head as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the caller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it was reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call touch_buffer() here in the first place.  So this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.",
