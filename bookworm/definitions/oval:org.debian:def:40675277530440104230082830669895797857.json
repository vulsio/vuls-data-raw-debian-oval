		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  icmp: change the order of rate limits  ICMP messages are ratelimited :  After the blamed commits, the two rate limiters are applied in this order:  1) host wide ratelimit (icmp_global_allow())  2) Per destination ratelimit (inetpeer based)  In order to avoid side-channels attacks, we need to apply the per destination check first.  This patch makes the following change :  1) icmp_global_allow() checks if the host wide limit is reached.    But credits are not yet consumed. This is deferred to 3)  2) The per destination limit is checked/updated.    This might add a new node in inetpeer tree.  3) icmp_global_consume() consumes tokens if prior operations succeeded.  This means that host wide ratelimit is still effective in keeping inetpeer tree small even under DDOS.  As a bonus, I removed icmp_global.lock as the fast path can use a lock-free operation.",
