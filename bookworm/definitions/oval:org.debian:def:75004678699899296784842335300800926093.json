		"description": "Guests can trigger deadlock in Linux netback driver T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] The patch for XSA-392 introduced another issue which might result in a deadlock when trying to free the SKB of a packet dropped due to the XSA-392 handling (CVE-2022-42328). Additionally when dropping packages for other reasons the same deadlock could occur in case of netpoll being active for the interface the xen-netback driver is connected to (CVE-2022-42329).",
