		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: brcmfmac: Fix use-after-free bug in brcmf_cfg80211_detach  This is the candidate patch of CVE-2023-47233 : https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47233  In brcm80211 driver,it starts with the following invoking chain to start init a timeout worker:  ->brcmf_usb_probe   ->brcmf_usb_probe_cb     ->brcmf_attach       ->brcmf_bus_started         ->brcmf_cfg80211_attach           ->wl_init_priv             ->brcmf_init_escan               ->INIT_WORK(&cfg->escan_timeout_work, \t\t  brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker);  If we disconnect the USB by hotplug, it will call brcmf_usb_disconnect to make cleanup. The invoking chain is :  brcmf_usb_disconnect   ->brcmf_usb_disconnect_cb     ->brcmf_detach       ->brcmf_cfg80211_detach         ->kfree(cfg);  While the timeout woker may still be running. This will cause a use-after-free bug on cfg in brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker.  Fix it by deleting the timer and canceling the worker in brcmf_cfg80211_detach.  [arend.vanspriel@broadcom.com: keep timer delete as is and cancel work just before free]",
