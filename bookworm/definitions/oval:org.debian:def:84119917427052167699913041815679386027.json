		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: dsa: microchip: Added the condition for scheduling ksz_mib_read_work  When the ksz module is installed and removed using rmmod, kernel crashes with null pointer dereferrence error. During rmmod, ksz_switch_remove function tries to cancel the mib_read_workqueue using cancel_delayed_work_sync routine and unregister switch from dsa.  During dsa_unregister_switch it calls ksz_mac_link_down, which in turn reschedules the workqueue since mib_interval is non-zero. Due to which queue executed after mib_interval and it tries to access dp->slave. But the slave is unregistered in the ksz_switch_remove function. Hence kernel crashes.  To avoid this crash, before canceling the workqueue, resetted the mib_interval to 0.  v1 -> v2: -Removed the if condition in ksz_mib_read_work",
