		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix masking negation logic upon negative dst register  The negation logic for the case where the off_reg is sitting in the dst register is not correct given then we cannot just invert the add to a sub or vice versa. As a fix, perform the final bitwise and-op unconditionally into AX from the off_reg, then move the pointer from the src to dst and finally use AX as the source for the original pointer arithmetic operation such that the inversion yields a correct result. The single non-AX mov in between is possible given constant blinding is retaining it as it's not an immediate based operation.",
