		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mfd: intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc: Use IRQ domain for TMU device  While design wise the idea of converting the driver to use the hierarchy of the IRQ chips is correct, the implementation has (inherited) flaws. This was unveiled when platform_get_irq() had started WARN() on IRQ 0 that is supposed to be a Linux IRQ number (also known as vIRQ).  Rework the driver to respect IRQ domain when creating each MFD device separately, as the domain is not the same for all of them.",
