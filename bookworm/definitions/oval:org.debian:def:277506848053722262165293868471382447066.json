		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Fix improper extts handling  Extts events are disabled and enabled by the application ts2phc. However, in case where the driver is removed when the application is running, a specific extts event remains enabled and can cause a kernel crash. As a side effect, when the driver is reloaded and application is started again, remaining extts event for the channel from a previous run will keep firing and the message \"extts on unexpected channel\" might be printed to the user.  To avoid that, extts events shall be disabled when PTP is released.",
