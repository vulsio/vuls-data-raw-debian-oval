		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix NULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend  In current scenario if Plug-out and Plug-In performed continuously there could be a chance while checking for dwc->gadget_driver in dwc3_gadget_suspend, a NULL pointer dereference may occur.  Call Stack:  \tCPU1:                           CPU2: \tgadget_unbind_driver            dwc3_suspend_common \tdwc3_gadget_stop                dwc3_gadget_suspend                                         dwc3_disconnect_gadget  CPU1 basically clears the variable and CPU2 checks the variable. Consider CPU1 is running and right before gadget_driver is cleared and in parallel CPU2 executes dwc3_gadget_suspend where it finds dwc->gadget_driver which is not NULL and resumes execution and then CPU1 completes execution. CPU2 executes dwc3_disconnect_gadget where it checks dwc->gadget_driver is already NULL because of which the NULL pointer deference occur.",
