		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Fix command bitmask initialization  Command bitmask have a dedicated bit for MANAGE_PAGES command, this bit isn't Initialize during command bitmask Initialization, only during MANAGE_PAGES.  In addition, mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() is trying to trigger completion for MANAGE_PAGES command as well.  Hence, in case health error occurred before any MANAGE_PAGES command have been invoke (for example, during mlx5_enable_hca()), mlx5_cmd_trigger_completions() will try to trigger completion for MANAGE_PAGES command, which will result in null-ptr-deref error.[1]  Fix it by Initialize command bitmask correctly.  While at it, re-write the code for better understanding.
