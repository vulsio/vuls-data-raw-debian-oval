		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bnxt: prevent skb UAF after handing over to PTP worker  When reading the timestamp is required bnxt_tx_int() hands over the ownership of the completed skb to the PTP worker. The skb should not be used afterwards, as the worker may run before the rest of our code and free the skb, leading to a use-after-free.  Since dev_kfree_skb_any() accepts NULL make the loss of ownership more obvious and set skb to NULL.",
