		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  rcu: Fix buffer overflow in print_cpu_stall_info()  The rcuc-starvation output from print_cpu_stall_info() might overflow the buffer if there is a huge difference in jiffies difference.  The situation might seem improbable, but computers sometimes get very confused about time, which can result in full-sized integers, and, in this case, buffer overflow.  Also, the unsigned jiffies difference is printed using %ld, which is normally for signed integers.  This is intentional for debugging purposes, but it is not obvious from the code.  This commit therefore changes sprintf() to snprintf() and adds a clarifying comment about intention of %ld format.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.",
