		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cachefiles: add missing lock protection when polling  Add missing lock protection in poll routine when iterating xarray, otherwise:  Even with RCU read lock held, only the slot of the radix tree is ensured to be pinned there, while the data structure (e.g. struct cachefiles_req) stored in the slot has no such guarantee.  The poll routine will iterate the radix tree and dereference cachefiles_req accordingly.  Thus RCU read lock is not adequate in this case and spinlock is needed here.",
