		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  blk-iocost: avoid out of bounds shift  UBSAN catches undefined behavior in blk-iocost, where sometimes iocg->delay is shifted right by a number that is too large, resulting in undefined behavior on some architectures.  [  186.556576] ------------[ cut here ]------------ UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in block/blk-iocost.c:1366:23 shift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bit type 'u64' (aka 'unsigned long long') CPU: 16 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/16 Tainted: G S          E    N 6.9.0-0_fbk700_debug_rc2_kbuilder_0_gc85af715cac0 #1 Hardware name: Quanta Twin Lakes MP/Twin Lakes Passive MP, BIOS F09_3A23 12/08/2020 Call Trace:  <IRQ>  dump_stack_lvl+0x8f/0xe0  __ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds+0x22c/0x280  iocg_kick_delay+0x30b/0x310  ioc_timer_fn+0x2fb/0x1f80  __run_timer_base+0x1b6/0x250 ...  Avoid that undefined behavior by simply taking the \"delay = 0\" branch if the shift is too large.  I am not sure what the symptoms of an undefined value delay will be, but I suspect it could be more than a little annoying to debug.",
