It has a show_preauthpage NULL pointer dereference that can be triggered with a crafted GET HTTP with a missing User-Agent header. Triggering this issue results in crashing OpenNDS (a Denial-of-Service condition). This problem was fixed in OpenWrt master, OpenWrt 23.05 and OpenWrt 22.03 on 28. August 2023 by updating OpenNDS to version 10.1.3.",
