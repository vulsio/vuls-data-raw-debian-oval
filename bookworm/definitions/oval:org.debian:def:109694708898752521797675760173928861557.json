		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: clear uffd-wp PTE/PMD state on mremap()  When mremap()ing a memory region previously registered with userfaultfd as write-protected but without UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMAP, an inconsistency in flag clearing leads to a mismatch between the vma flags (which have uffd-wp cleared) and the pte/pmd flags (which do not have uffd-wp cleared).  This mismatch causes a subsequent mprotect(PROT_WRITE) to trigger a warning in page_table_check_pte_flags() due to setting the pte to writable while uffd-wp is still set.  Fix this by always explicitly clearing the uffd-wp pte/pmd flags on any such mremap() so that the values are consistent with the existing clearing of VM_UFFD_WP.  Be careful to clear the logical flag regardless of its physical form; a PTE bit, a swap PTE bit, or a PTE marker.  Cover PTE, huge PMD and hugetlb paths.",
