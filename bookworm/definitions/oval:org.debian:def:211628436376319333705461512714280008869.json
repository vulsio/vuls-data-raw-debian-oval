		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: huge_memory: don't force huge page alignment on 32 bit  commit efa7df3e3bb5 (\"mm: align larger anonymous mappings on THP boundaries\") caused two issues [1] [2] reported on 32 bit system or compat userspace.  It doesn't make too much sense to force huge page alignment on 32 bit system due to the constrained virtual address space.
