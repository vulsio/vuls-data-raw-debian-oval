		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: mt7621: Add sentinel to quirks table  Current driver is missing a sentinel in the struct soc_device_attribute array, which causes an oops when assessed by the soc_device_match(mt7621_pcie_quirks_match) call.  This was only exposed once the CONFIG_SOC_MT7621 mt7621 soc_dev_attr was fixed to register the SOC as a device, in:  commit 7c18b64bba3b (\"mips: ralink: mt7621: do not use kzalloc too early\")  Fix it by adding the required sentinel.",
