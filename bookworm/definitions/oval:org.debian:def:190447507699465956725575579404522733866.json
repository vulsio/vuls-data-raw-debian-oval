		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: usx2y: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnection  The USB disconnect callback is supposed to be short and not too-long waiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() at disconnection, but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence it can take long.  It eventually blocks the upper layer USB ioctls, which may trigger a soft lockup.  An easy workaround is to replace snd_card_free() with snd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately while the release of resources is done asynchronously by the card device release at the last close.",
