		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/qeth: fix deadlock during failing recovery  Commit 0b9902c1fcc5 (\"s390/qeth: fix deadlock during recovery\") removed taking discipline_mutex inside qeth_do_reset(), fixing potential deadlocks. An error path was missed though, that still takes discipline_mutex and thus has the original deadlock potential.  Intermittent deadlocks were seen when a qeth channel path is configured offline, causing a race between qeth_do_reset and ccwgroup_remove. Call qeth_set_offline() directly in the qeth_do_reset() error case and then a new variant of ccwgroup_set_offline(), without taking discipline_mutex.",
