		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder  Not all decoders have a reset callback.  The CXL specification allows a host bridge with a single root port to have no explicit HDM decoders. Currently the region driver assumes there are none.  As such the CXL core creates a special pass through decoder instance without a commit/reset callback.  Prior to this patch, the ->reset() callback was called unconditionally when calling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge, 1 Root Port, and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXL type 3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a null pointer dereference.  Before the fix, a kernel crash was observed when we destroy the region, and a pass through decoder is reset.  The issue can be reproduced as below,     1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes a HB with a     single root port under which a memdev is attached directly.     2) destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f.",
