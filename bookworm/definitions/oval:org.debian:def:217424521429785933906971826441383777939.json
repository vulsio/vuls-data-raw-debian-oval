		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  fou: remove warn in gue_gro_receive on unsupported protocol  Drop the WARN_ON_ONCE inn gue_gro_receive if the encapsulated type is not known or does not have a GRO handler.  Such a packet is easily constructed. Syzbot generates them and sets off this warning.  Remove the warning as it is expected and not actionable.  The warning was previously reduced from WARN_ON to WARN_ON_ONCE in commit 270136613bf7 (\"fou: Do WARN_ON_ONCE in gue_gro_receive for bad proto callbacks\").",
