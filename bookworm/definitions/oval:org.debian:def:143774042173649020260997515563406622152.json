		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring: check if iowq is killed before queuing  task work can be executed after the task has gone through io_uring termination, whether it's the final task_work run or the fallback path. In this case, task work will find ->io_wq being already killed and null'ed, which is a problem if it then tries to forward the request to io_queue_iowq(). Make io_queue_iowq() fail requests in this case.  Note that it also checks PF_KTHREAD, because the user can first close a DEFER_TASKRUN ring and shortly after kill the task, in which case ->iowq check would race.",
