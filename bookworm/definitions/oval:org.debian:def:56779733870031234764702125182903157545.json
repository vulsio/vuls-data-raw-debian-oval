		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/mglru: fix div-by-zero in vmpressure_calc_level()  evict_folios() uses a second pass to reclaim folios that have gone through page writeback and become clean before it finishes the first pass, since folio_rotate_reclaimable() cannot handle those folios due to the isolation.  The second pass tries to avoid potential double counting by deducting scan_control->nr_scanned.  However, this can result in underflow of nr_scanned, under a condition where shrink_folio_list() does not increment nr_scanned, i.e., when folio_trylock() fails.  The underflow can cause the divisor, i.e., scale=scanned+reclaimed in vmpressure_calc_level(), to become zero, resulting in the following crash:    [exception RIP: vmpressure_work_fn+101]   process_one_work at ffffffffa3313f2b  Since scan_control->nr_scanned has no established semantics, the potential double counting has minimal risks.  Therefore, fix the problem by not deducting scan_control->nr_scanned in evict_folios().",
