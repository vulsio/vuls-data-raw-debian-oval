		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/rds: fix possible cp null dereference  cp might be null, calling cp->cp_conn would produce null dereference  [Simon Horman adds:]  Analysis:  * cp is a parameter of __rds_rdma_map and is not reassigned.  * The following call-sites pass a NULL cp argument to __rds_rdma_map()    - rds_get_mr()   - rds_get_mr_for_dest  * Prior to the code above, the following assumes that cp may be NULL   (which is indicative, but could itself be unnecessary)  \ttrans_private = rs->rs_transport->get_mr( \t\tsg, nents, rs, &mr->r_key, cp ? cp->cp_conn : NULL, \t\targs->vec.addr, args->vec.bytes, \t\tneed_odp ? ODP_ZEROBASED : ODP_NOT_NEEDED);  * The code modified by this patch is guarded by IS_ERR(trans_private),   where trans_private is assigned as per the previous point in this analysis.    The only implementation of get_mr that I could locate is rds_ib_get_mr()   which can return an ERR_PTR if the conn (4th) argument is NULL.  * ret is set to PTR_ERR(trans_private).   rds_ib_get_mr can return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) if the conn (4th) argument is NULL.   Thus ret may be -ENODEV in which case the code in question will execute.  Conclusion: * cp may be NULL at the point where this patch adds a check;   this patch does seem to address a possible bug",
