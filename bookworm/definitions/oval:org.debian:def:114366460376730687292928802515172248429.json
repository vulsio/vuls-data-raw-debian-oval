		"description": "PCI devices with RMRRs not deassigned correctly Certain PCI devices in a system might be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via Reserved Memory Region Reporting, \"RMRR\"). These are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation. If such a device is passed through to a guest, then on guest shutdown the device is not properly deassigned. The IOMMU configuration for these devices which are not properly deassigned ends up pointing to a freed data structure, including the IO Pagetables. Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device will have unpredictable behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption.",
