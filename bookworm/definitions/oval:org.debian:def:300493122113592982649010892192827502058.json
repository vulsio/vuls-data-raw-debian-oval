		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit  If a device sends a packet that is inbetween 0 and sizeof(u64) the value passed to skb_trim() as length will wrap around ending up as some very large value.  The driver will then proceed to parse the header located at that position, which will either oops or process some random value.  The fix is to check against sizeof(u64) rather than 0, which the driver currently does. The issue exists since the introduction of the driver.",
