		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dmaengine: dw-edma: eDMA: Add sync read before starting the DMA transfer in remote setup  The Linked list element and pointer are not stored in the same memory as the eDMA controller register. If the doorbell register is toggled before the full write of the linked list a race condition error will occur. In remote setup we can only use a readl to the memory to assure the full write has occurred.",
