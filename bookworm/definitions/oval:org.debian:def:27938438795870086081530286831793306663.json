		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-rdma: destroy cm id before destroy qp to avoid use after free  We should always destroy cm_id before destroy qp to avoid to get cma event after qp was destroyed, which may lead to use after free. In RDMA connection establishment error flow, don't destroy qp in cm event handler.Just report cm_error to upper level, qp will be destroy in nvme_rdma_alloc_queue() after destroy cm id.",
