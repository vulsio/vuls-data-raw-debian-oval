		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/page_table_check: fix crash on ZONE_DEVICE  Not all pages may apply to pgtable check.  One example is ZONE_DEVICE pages: they map PFNs directly, and they don't allocate page_ext at all even if there's struct page around.  One may reference devm_memremap_pages().  When both ZONE_DEVICE and page-table-check enabled, then try to map some dax memories, one can trigger kernel bug constantly now when the kernel was trying to inject some pfn maps on the dax device:   kernel BUG at mm/page_table_check.c:55!  While it's pretty legal to use set_pxx_at() for ZONE_DEVICE pages for page fault resolutions, skip all the checks if page_ext doesn't even exist in pgtable checker, which applies to ZONE_DEVICE but maybe more.",
