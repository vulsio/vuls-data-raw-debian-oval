		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: ensure offloading TID queue exists  The resume code path assumes that the TX queue for the offloading TID has been configured. At resume time it then tries to sync the write pointer as it may have been updated by the firmware.  In the unusual event that no packets have been send on TID 0, the queue will not have been allocated and this causes a crash. Fix this by ensuring the queue exist at suspend time.",
