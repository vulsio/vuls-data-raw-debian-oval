		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ALSA: timer: Set lower bound of start tick time  Currently ALSA timer doesn't have the lower limit of the start tick time, and it allows a very small size, e.g. 1 tick with 1ns resolution for hrtimer.  Such a situation may lead to an unexpected RCU stall, where  the callback repeatedly queuing the expire update, as reported by fuzzer.  This patch introduces a sanity check of the timer start tick time, so that the system returns an error when a too small start size is set. As of this patch, the lower limit is hard-coded to 100us, which is small enough but can still work somehow.",
