		"description": "A defect was discovered in the Python “ssl” module where there is a memory race condition with the ssl.SSLContext methods “cert_store_stats()” and “get_ca_certs()”. The race condition can be triggered if the methods are called at the same time as certificates are loaded into the SSLContext, such as during the TLS handshake with a certificate directory configured. This issue is fixed in CPython 3.10.14, 3.11.9, 3.12.3, and 3.13.0a5.",
