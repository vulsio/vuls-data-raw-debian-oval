		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  serial: max3100: Lock port->lock when calling uart_handle_cts_change()  uart_handle_cts_change() has to be called with port lock taken, Since we run it in a separate work, the lock may not be taken at the time of running. Make sure that it's taken by explicitly doing that. Without it we got a splat:    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 10 at drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c:3491 uart_handle_cts_change+0xa6/0xb0   ...
