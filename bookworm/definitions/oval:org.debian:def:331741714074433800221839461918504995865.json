		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  hwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng  There is a dead-lock in the hwrng device read path.  This triggers when the user reads from /dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from /dev/hwrng.  The resulting page fault triggers a recursive read which then dead-locks.  Fix this by using a stack buffer when calling copy_to_user.",
