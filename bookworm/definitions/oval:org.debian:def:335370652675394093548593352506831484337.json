The HTTP/2 protocol implementation did not sufficiently verify if HPACK header values exceed their size limit. Furthermore the HTTP/2 protocol allowed a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly. This problem is also known as Rapid Reset Attack.",
