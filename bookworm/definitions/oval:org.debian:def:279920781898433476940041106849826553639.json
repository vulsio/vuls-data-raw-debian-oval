		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: support deferring bpf_link dealloc to after RCU grace period  BPF link for some program types is passed as a \"context\" which can be used by those BPF programs to look up additional information. E.g., for multi-kprobes and multi-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values.  Because of this runtime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zero there could still be active BPF programs running accessing link data.  This patch adds generic support to defer bpf_link dealloc callback to after RCU GP, if requested. This is done by exposing two different deallocation callbacks, one synchronous and one deferred. If deferred one is provided, bpf_link_free() will schedule dealloc_deferred() callback to happen after RCU GP.  BPF is using two flavors of RCU: \"classic\" non-sleepable one and RCU tasks trace one. The latter is used when sleepable BPF programs are used. bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPF program's sleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only for non-sleepable, or through RCU tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP (taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization), if BPF program is sleepable.  We use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links, which dereference link during program run. We also preventively switch raw_tp link to use deferred dealloc callback, as upcoming changes in bpf-next tree expose raw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value) to BPF program at runtime as well.",
