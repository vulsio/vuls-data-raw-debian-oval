When processing a WebDAV request body containing XML, the XML parser could be instructed to read content from network resources accessible to the host, identified by URI schemes such as <q>http(s)</q> or <q>file</q>. Depending on the WebDAV request, this could not only be used to trigger internal network requests, but might also be used to insert said content into the request, potentially exposing it to the attacker and others.",
