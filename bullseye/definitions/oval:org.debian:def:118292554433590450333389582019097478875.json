		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac: Disable Tx queues when reconfiguring the interface  The Tx queues were not disabled in situations where the driver needed to stop the interface to apply a new configuration. This could result in a kernel panic when doing any of the 3 following actions: * reconfiguring the number of queues (ethtool -L) * reconfiguring the size of the ring buffers (ethtool -G) * installing/removing an XDP program (ip l set dev ethX xdp)  Prevent the panic by making sure netif_tx_disable is called when stopping an interface.  Without this patch, the following kernel panic can be observed when doing any of the actions above:  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff80001238d040 [....]  Call trace:   dwmac4_set_addr+0x8/0x10   dev_hard_start_xmit+0xe4/0x1ac   sch_direct_xmit+0xe8/0x39c   __dev_queue_xmit+0x3ec/0xaf0   dev_queue_xmit+0x14/0x20 [...] [ end trace 0000000000000002 ]---",
