		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/smp: do not decrement idle task preempt count in CPU offline  With PREEMPT_COUNT=y, when a CPU is offlined and then onlined again, we get:  BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/1/0/0x00000000 no locks held by swapper/1/0. CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #100 Call Trace:  dump_stack_lvl+0xac/0x108  __schedule_bug+0xac/0xe0  __schedule+0xcf8/0x10d0  schedule_idle+0x3c/0x70  do_idle+0x2d8/0x4a0  cpu_startup_entry+0x38/0x40  start_secondary+0x2ec/0x3a0  start_secondary_prolog+0x10/0x14  This is because powerpc's arch_cpu_idle_dead() decrements the idle task's preempt count, for reasons explained in commit a7c2bb8279d2 (\"powerpc: Re-enable preemption before cpu_die()\"), specifically \"start_secondary() expects a preempt_count() of 0.\"  However, since commit 2c669ef6979c (\"powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idle task's preempt_count during hotplug\") and commit f1a0a376ca0c (\"sched/core: Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled\"), that justification no longer holds.  The idle task isn't supposed to re-enable preemption, so remove the vestigial preempt_enable() from the CPU offline path.  Tested with pseries and powernv in qemu, and pseries on PowerVM.",
