		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tty: add the option to have a tty reject a new ldisc  ... and use it to limit the virtual terminals to just N_TTY.  They are kind of special, and in particular, the \"con_write()\" routine violates the \"writes cannot sleep\" rule that some ldiscs rely on.  This avoids the     BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/printk/printk.c:2659  when N_GSM has been attached to a virtual console, and gsmld_write() calls con_write() while holding a spinlock, and con_write() then tries to get the console lock.",
