		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-multipath: defer partition scanning  We need to suppress the partition scan from occuring within the controller's scan_work context. If a path error occurs here, the IO will wait until a path becomes available or all paths are torn down, but that action also occurs within scan_work, so it would deadlock. Defer the partion scan to a different context that does not block scan_work.",
