		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KEYS: trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal  The original patch 8c657a0590de (\"KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for seal and unseal operations\") was correct on the mailing list:  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/  But somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() in tpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.  This causes an imbalanced put of the TPM ops and causes oopses on TIS based hardware.  This fix puts back the lost tpm_try_get_ops()",
