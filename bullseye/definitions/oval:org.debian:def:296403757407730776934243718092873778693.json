		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: Sync efi page table's kernel mappings before switching  The EFI page table is initially created as a copy of the kernel page table. With VMAP_STACK enabled, kernel stacks are allocated in the vmalloc area: if the stack is allocated in a new PGD (one that was not present at the moment of the efi page table creation or not synced in a previous vmalloc fault), the kernel will take a trap when switching to the efi page table when the vmalloc kernel stack is accessed, resulting in a kernel panic.  Fix that by updating the efi kernel mappings before switching to the efi page table.",
