		"description": "swt/motif/browser.c in White_dune (aka whitedune) 0.30.10 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: This issue is being disputed as not being a vulnerability because â€œthe current version of white_dune (1.369 at https://wdune.ourproject.org/) do not use a \"BROWSER environment variable\". Instead, the \"browser\" variable is read from the $HOME/.dunerc file (or from the M$Windows registry). It is configurable in the \"options\" menu. The default is chosen in the ./configure script, which tests various programs, first tested is \"xdg-open\".",
