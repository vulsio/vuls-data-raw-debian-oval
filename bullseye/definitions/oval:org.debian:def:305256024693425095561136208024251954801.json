		"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels memory deduplication mechanism. Previous work has shown that memory deduplication can be attacked via a local exploitation mechanism. The same technique can be used if an attacker can upload page sized files and detect the change in access time from a networked service to determine if the page has been merged.",
