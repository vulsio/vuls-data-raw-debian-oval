		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  powerpc/32: Fix hardlockup on vmap stack overflow  Since the commit c118c7303ad5 (\"powerpc/32: Fix vmap stack - Do not activate MMU before reading task struct\") a vmap stack overflow results in a hard lockup. This is because emergency_ctx is still addressed with its virtual address allthough data MMU is not active anymore at that time.  Fix it by using a physical address instead.",
