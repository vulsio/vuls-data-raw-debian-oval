		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/msm/dpu: Add mutex lock in control vblank irq  Add a mutex lock to control vblank irq to synchronize vblank enable/disable operations happening from different threads to prevent race conditions while registering/unregistering the vblank irq callback.  v4: -Removed vblank_ctl_lock from dpu_encoder_virt, so it is only a     parameter of dpu_encoder_phys.     -Switch from atomic refcnt to a simple int counter as mutex has     now been added v3: Mistakenly did not change wording in last version. It is done now. v2: Slightly changed wording of commit message  Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/571854/",
