		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove  A PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev->cdev is held open. The call to stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way past switchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the trailing put_device(), just before return.  At that later point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the stdev->mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev->pdev reference was not a counted one. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause a fatal page fault, and the subsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached, would pass a stale &stdev->pdev->dev pointer.  Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(), after stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev->pdev ref is now optional, but may prevent future accidents.  Reproducible via the script at https://lore.kernel.org/r/20231113212150.96410-1-dns@arista.com",
