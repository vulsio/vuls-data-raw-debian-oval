		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  arm64: acpi: Harden get_cpu_for_acpi_id() against missing CPU entry  In a review discussion of the changes to support vCPU hotplug where a check was added on the GICC being enabled if was online, it was noted that there is need to map back to the cpu and use that to index into a cpumask. As such, a valid ID is needed.  If an MPIDR check fails in acpi_map_gic_cpu_interface() it is possible for the entry in cpu_madt_gicc[cpu] == NULL.  This function would then cause a NULL pointer dereference.   Whilst a path to trigger this has not been established, harden this caller against the possibility.",
