		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v4: Don't allow a VMOVP on a dying VPE  Kunkun Jiang reported that there is a small window of opportunity for userspace to force a change of affinity for a VPE while the VPE has already been unmapped, but the corresponding doorbell interrupt still visible in /proc/irq/.  Plug the race by checking the value of vmapp_count, which tracks whether the VPE is mapped ot not, and returning an error in this case.  This involves making vmapp_count common to both GICv4.1 and its v4.0 ancestor.",
