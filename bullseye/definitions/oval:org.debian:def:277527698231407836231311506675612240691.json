		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: seeq: Fix use after free vulnerability in ether3 Driver Due to Race Condition  In the ether3_probe function, a timer is initialized with a callback function ether3_ledoff, bound to &prev(dev)->timer. Once the timer is started, there is a risk of a race condition if the module or device is removed, triggering the ether3_remove function to perform cleanup. The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:  CPU0                                    CPU1                        |  ether3_ledoff ether3_remove         |   free_netdev(dev);   |   put_devic           |   kfree(dev);         |  |  ether3_outw(priv(dev)->regs.config2 |= CFG2_CTRLO, REG_CONFIG2);                       | // use dev  Fix it by ensuring that the timer is canceled before proceeding with the cleanup in ether3_remove.",
