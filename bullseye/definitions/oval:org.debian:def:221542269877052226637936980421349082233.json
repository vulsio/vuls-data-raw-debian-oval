		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  can: hi311x: hi3110_can_ist(): fix potential use-after-free  The commit a22bd630cfff (\"can: hi311x: do not report txerr and rxerr during bus-off\") removed the reporting of rxerr and txerr even in case of correct operation (i. e. not bus-off).  The error count information added to the CAN frame after netif_rx() is a potential use after free, since there is no guarantee that the skb is in the same state. It might be freed or reused.  Fix the issue by postponing the netif_rx() call in case of txerr and rxerr reporting.",
