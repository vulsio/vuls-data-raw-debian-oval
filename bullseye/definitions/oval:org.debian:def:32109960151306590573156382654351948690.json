		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Fix system hang while resume with TBT monitor  [Why] Connected with a Thunderbolt monitor and do the suspend and the system may hang while resume.  The TBT monitor HPD will be triggered during the resume procedure and call the drm_client_modeset_probe() while struct drm_connector connector->dev->master is NULL.  It will mess up the pipe topology after resume.  [How] Skip the TBT monitor HPD during the resume procedure because we currently will probe the connectors after resume by default.  (cherry picked from commit 453f86a26945207a16b8f66aaed5962dc2b95b85)",
