		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/sched: stop qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog on TC_H_ROOT  In qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog, Qdiscs with major handle ffff: are assumed to be either root or ingress. This assumption is bogus since it's valid to create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff: Budimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an active class list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer.  In 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingress qdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parent TC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when a hierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call into qdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT).  In the scenario where major ffff: is an egress qdisc in any of the tree levels, the updates will also propagate to TC_H_ROOT, which then the iteration must stop.    net/sched/sch_api.c | 2 +-  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)",
