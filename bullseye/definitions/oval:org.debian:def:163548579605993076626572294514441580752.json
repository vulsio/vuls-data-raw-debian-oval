		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: nfc: fix races in nfc_llcp_sock_get() and nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn()  Sili Luo reported a race in nfc_llcp_sock_get(), leading to UAF.  Getting a reference on the socket found in a lookup while holding a lock should happen before releasing the lock.  nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn() has a similar problem.  Finally nfc_llcp_recv_snl() needs to make sure the socket found by nfc_llcp_sock_from_sn() does not disappear.",
