		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list  At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively.  If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences otherwise.  So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.",
