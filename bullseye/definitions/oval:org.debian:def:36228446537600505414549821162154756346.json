		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: virt_wifi: avoid reporting connection success with wrong SSID  When user issues a connection with a different SSID than the one virt_wifi has advertised, the __cfg80211_connect_result() will trigger the warning: WARN_ON(bss_not_found).  The issue is because the connection code in virt_wifi does not check the SSID from user space (it only checks the BSSID), and virt_wifi will call cfg80211_connect_result() with WLAN_STATUS_SUCCESS even if the SSID is different from the one virt_wifi has advertised. Eventually cfg80211 won't be able to find the cfg80211_bss and generate the warning.  Fixed it by checking the SSID (from user space) in the connection code.",
