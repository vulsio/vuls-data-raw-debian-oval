		"description": "An issue was discovered in Sangoma Asterisk 16.x before 16.16.1, 17.x before 17.9.2, and 18.x before 18.2.1 and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert6. When re-negotiating for T.38, if the initial remote response was delayed just enough, Asterisk would send both audio and T.38 in the SDP. If this happened, and the remote responded with a declined T.38 stream, then Asterisk would crash.",
