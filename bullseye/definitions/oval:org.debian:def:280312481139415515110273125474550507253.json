		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places  For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 (\"aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts\") makes tx() calling dev_put() instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs into use-after-free.  Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe() and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the refcnt of skb->dev.  On the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of skb->dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding dev_hold() are not called in revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe(), and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). This patch fixed this issue.",
