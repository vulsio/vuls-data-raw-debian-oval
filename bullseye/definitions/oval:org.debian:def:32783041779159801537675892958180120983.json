		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: acpi: fix resource leak in reconfiguration device addition  acpi_i2c_find_adapter_by_handle() calls bus_find_device() which takes a reference on the adapter which is never released which will result in a reference count leak and render the adapter unremovable.  Make sure to put the adapter after creating the client in the same manner that we do for OF.  [wsa: fixed title]",
