		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tick/broadcast: Move per CPU pointer access into the atomic section  The recent fix for making the take over of the broadcast timer more reliable retrieves a per CPU pointer in preemptible context.  This went unnoticed as compilers hoist the access into the non-preemptible region where the pointer is actually used. But of course it's valid that the compiler keeps it at the place where the code puts it which rightfully triggers:    BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code:        caller is hotplug_cpu__broadcast_tick_pull+0x1c/0xc0  Move it to the actual usage site which is in a non-preemptible region.",
