		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: fix kernel bug due to missing clearing of checked flag  Syzbot reported that in directory operations after nilfs2 detects filesystem corruption and degrades to read-only, __block_write_begin_int(), which is called to prepare block writes, may fail the BUG_ON check for accesses exceeding the folio/page size, triggering a kernel bug.  This was found to be because the \"checked\" flag of a page/folio was not cleared when it was discarded by nilfs2's own routine, which causes the sanity check of directory entries to be skipped when the directory page/folio is reloaded.  So, fix that.  This was necessary when the use of nilfs2's own page discard routine was applied to more than just metadata files.",
