		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdev  During successful probe, igc logs this:  [    5.133667] igc 0000:01:00.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): PHC added                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The reason is that igc_ptp_init() is called very early, even before register_netdev() has been called. So the netdev_info() call works on a partially uninitialized netdev.  Fix this by calling igc_ptp_init() after register_netdev(), right after the media autosense check, just as in igb.  Add a comment, just as in igb.  Now the log message is fine:  [    5.200987] igc 0000:01:00.0 eth0: PHC added",
