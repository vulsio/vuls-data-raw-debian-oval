		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cache  There is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation cache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, such as a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that vgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq before dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.  Have vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq and add the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.",
