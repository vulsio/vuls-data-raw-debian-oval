		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  gpiolib: fix memory leak in gpiochip_setup_dev()  Here is a backtrace report about memory leak detected in gpiochip_setup_dev():  unreferenced object 0xffff88810b406400 (size 512):   comm \"python3\", pid 1682, jiffies 4295346908 (age 24.090s)   backtrace:     kmalloc_trace     device_add\t\tdevice_private_init at drivers/base/core.c:3361 \t\t\t(inlined by) device_add at drivers/base/core.c:3411     cdev_device_add     gpiolib_cdev_register     gpiochip_setup_dev     gpiochip_add_data_with_key  gcdev_register() & gcdev_unregister() would call device_add() & device_del() (no matter CONFIG_GPIO_CDEV is enabled or not) to register/unregister device.  However, if device_add() succeeds, some resource (like struct device_private allocated by device_private_init()) is not released by device_del().  Therefore, after device_add() succeeds by gcdev_register(), it needs to call put_device() to release resource in the error handle path.  Here we move forward the register of release function, and let it release every piece of resource by put_device() instead of kfree().  While at it, fix another subtle issue, i.e. when gc->ngpio is equal to 0, we still call kcalloc() and, in case of further error, kfree() on the ZERO_PTR pointer, which is not NULL. It's not a bug per se, but rather waste of the resources and potentially wrong expectation about contents of the gdev->descs variable.",
