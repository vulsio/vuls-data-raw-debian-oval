		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  s390/sclp: Prevent release of buffer in I/O  When a task waiting for completion of a Store Data operation is interrupted, an attempt is made to halt this operation. If this attempt fails due to a hardware or firmware problem, there is a chance that the SCLP facility might store data into buffers referenced by the original operation at a later time.  Handle this situation by not releasing the referenced data buffers if the halt attempt fails. For current use cases, this might result in a leak of few pages of memory in case of a rare hardware/firmware malfunction.",
