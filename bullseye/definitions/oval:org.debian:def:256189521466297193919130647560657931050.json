		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  acpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds Read in acpi_nfit_ctl  Fix an issue detected by syzbot with KASAN:  BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in cmd_to_func drivers/acpi/nfit/ core.c:416 [inline] BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in acpi_nfit_ctl+0x20e8/0x24a0 drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:459  The issue occurs in cmd_to_func when the call_pkg->nd_reserved2 array is accessed without verifying that call_pkg points to a buffer that is appropriately sized as a struct nd_cmd_pkg. This can lead to out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior if the buffer does not have sufficient space.  To address this, a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure that buf is not NULL and that buf_len is less than sizeof(*call_pkg) before accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members of call_pkg, including the nd_reserved2 array.",
