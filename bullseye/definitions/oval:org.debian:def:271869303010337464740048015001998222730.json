		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mips: bmips: BCM6358: make sure CBR is correctly set  It was discovered that some device have CBR address set to 0 causing kernel panic when arch_sync_dma_for_cpu_all is called.  This was notice in situation where the system is booted from TP1 and BMIPS_GET_CBR() returns 0 instead of a valid address and !!(read_c0_brcm_cmt_local() & (1 << 31)); not failing.  The current check whether RAC flush should be disabled or not are not enough hence lets check if CBR is a valid address or not.",
