		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cifs: fix underflow in parse_server_interfaces()  In this loop, we step through the buffer and after each item we check if the size_left is greater than the minimum size we need.  However, the problem is that \"bytes_left\" is type ssize_t while sizeof() is type size_t.  That means that because of type promotion, the comparison is done as an unsigned and if we have negative bytes left the loop continues instead of ending.",
