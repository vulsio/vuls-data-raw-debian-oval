		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: imx: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails  In i2c_imx_xfer() and i2c_imx_remove(), the pm reference count is not expected to be incremented on return.  However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm reference count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result in a reference leak here.  Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage counter balanced.",
