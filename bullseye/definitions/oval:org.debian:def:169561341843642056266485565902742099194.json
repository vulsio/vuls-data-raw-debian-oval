		"description": "eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, manipulated DATA Submessage can cause a heap overflow error in the Fast-DDS process, causing the process to be terminated remotely. Additionally, the payload_size in the DATA Submessage packet is declared as uint32_t. When a negative number, such as -1, is input into this variable, it results in an Integer Overflow (for example, -1 gets converted to 0xFFFFFFFF). This eventually leads to a heap-buffer-overflow, causing the program to terminate. Versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a fix for this issue.",
