		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Add null check for 'afb' in amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update (v2)  This commit adds a null check for the 'afb' variable in the amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update function. Previously, 'afb' was assumed to be null, but was used later in the code without a null check. This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference.  Changes since v1: - Moved the null check for 'afb' to the line where 'afb' is used. (Alex)  Fixes the below: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm_plane.c:1298 amdgpu_dm_plane_handle_cursor_update() error: we previously assumed 'afb' could be null (see line 1252)",
