		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: make sure the first directory block is not a hole  The syzbot constructs a directory that has no dirblock but is non-inline, i.e. the first directory block is a hole. And no errors are reported when creating files in this directory in the following flow.      ext4_mknod      ...       ext4_add_entry         // Read block 0         ext4_read_dirblock(dir, block, DIRENT)           bh = ext4_bread(NULL, inode, block, 0)           if (!bh && (type == INDEX || type == DIRENT_HTREE))           // The first directory block is a hole           // But type == DIRENT, so no error is reported.  After that, we get a directory block without '.' and '..' but with a valid dentry. This may cause some code that relies on dot or dotdot (such as make_indexed_dir()) to crash.  Therefore when ext4_read_dirblock() finds that the first directory block is a hole report that the filesystem is corrupted and return an error to avoid loading corrupted data from disk causing something bad.",
