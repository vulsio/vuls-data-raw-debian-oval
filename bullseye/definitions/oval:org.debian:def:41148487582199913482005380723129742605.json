		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  KVM: LAPIC: Also cancel preemption timer during SET_LAPIC  The below warning is splatting during guest reboot.    ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1931 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:10322 kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm]   CPU: 0 PID: 1931 Comm: qemu-system-x86 Tainted: G          I       5.17.0-rc1+ #5   RIP: 0010:kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm]   Call Trace:    <TASK>    kvm_vcpu_ioctl+0x279/0x710 [kvm]    __x64_sys_ioctl+0x83/0xb0    do_syscall_64+0x3b/0xc0    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae   RIP: 0033:0x7fd39797350b  This can be triggered by not exposing tsc-deadline mode and doing a reboot in the guest. The lapic_shutdown() function which is called in sys_reboot path will not disarm the flying timer, it just masks LVTT. lapic_shutdown() clears APIC state w/ LVT_MASKED and timer-mode bit is 0, this can trigger timer-mode switch between tsc-deadline and oneshot/periodic, which can result in preemption timer be cancelled in apic_update_lvtt(). However, We can't depend on this when not exposing tsc-deadline mode and oneshot/periodic modes emulated by preemption timer. Qemu will synchronise states around reset, let's cancel preemption timer under KVM_SET_LAPIC.",
