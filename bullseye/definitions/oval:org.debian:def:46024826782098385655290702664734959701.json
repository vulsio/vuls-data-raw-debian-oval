		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  clk: mediatek: Do a runtime PM get on controllers during probe  mt8183-mfgcfg has a mutual dependency with genpd during the probing stage, which leads to a deadlock in the following call stack:  CPU0:  genpd_lock --> clk_prepare_lock genpd_power_off_work_fn()  genpd_lock()  generic_pm_domain::power_off()     clk_unprepare()       clk_prepare_lock()  CPU1: clk_prepare_lock --> genpd_lock clk_register()   __clk_core_init()     clk_prepare_lock()     clk_pm_runtime_get()       genpd_lock()  Do a runtime PM get at the probe function to make sure clk_register() won't acquire the genpd lock. Instead of only modifying mt8183-mfgcfg, do this on all mediatek clock controller probings because we don't believe this would cause any regression.  Verified on MT8183 and MT8192 Chromebooks.",
