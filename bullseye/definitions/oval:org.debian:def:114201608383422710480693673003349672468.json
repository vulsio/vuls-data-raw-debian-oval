			"moreinfo": "Gregor Kopf of Secfault Security GmbH discovered that HSQLDB, a Java SQL database engine, allowed the execution of spurious scripting commands in .script and .log files. Hsqldb supports a <q>SCRIPT</q> keyword which is normally used to record the commands input by the database admin to output such a script. In combination with LibreOffice, an attacker could craft an odb containing a \"database/script\" file which itself contained a SCRIPT command where the contents of the file could be written to a new file whose location was determined by the attacker.",
