		"description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM guest OS users to achieve unintended read/write DMA access, and possibly cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or gain privileges. This occurs because a backport missed a flush, and thus IOMMU updates were not always correct. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-15565.",
