		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: sync_linked_regs() must preserve subreg_def  Range propagation must not affect subreg_def marks, otherwise the following example is rewritten by verifier incorrectly when BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag is set:    0: call bpf_ktime_get_ns                   call bpf_ktime_get_ns   1: r0 &= 0x7fffffff       after verifier   r0 &= 0x7fffffff   2: w1 = w0                rewrites         w1 = w0   3: if w0 < 10 goto +0     -------------->  r11 = 0x2f5674a6     (r)   4: r1 >>= 32                               r11 <<= 32           (r)   5: r0 = r1                                 r1 |= r11            (r)   6: exit;                                   if w0 < 0xa goto pc+0                                              r1 >>= 32                                              r0 = r1                                              exit  (or zero extension of w1 at (2) is missing for architectures that  require zero extension for upper register half).  The following happens w/o this patch: - r0 is marked as not a subreg at (0); - w1 is marked as subreg at (2); - w1 subreg_def is overridden at (3) by copy_register_state(); - w1 is read at (5) but mark_insn_zext() does not mark (2)   for zero extension, because w1 subreg_def is not set; - because of BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag verifier inserts random   value for hi32 bits of (2) (marked (r)); - this random value is read at (5).",
