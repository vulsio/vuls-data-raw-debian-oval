		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/smc: Transitional solution for clcsock race issue  We encountered a crash in smc_setsockopt() and it is caused by accessing smc->clcsock after clcsock was released.   BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page  PGD 0 P4D 0  Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI  CPU: 1 PID: 50309 Comm: nginx Kdump: loaded Tainted: G E     5.16.0-rc4+ #53  RIP: 0010:smc_setsockopt+0x59/0x280 [smc]  Call Trace:   <TASK>   __sys_setsockopt+0xfc/0x190   __x64_sys_setsockopt+0x20/0x30   do_syscall_64+0x34/0x90   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae  RIP: 0033:0x7f16ba83918e   </TASK>  This patch tries to fix it by holding clcsock_release_lock and checking whether clcsock has already been released before access.  In case that a crash of the same reason happens in smc_getsockopt() or smc_switch_to_fallback(), this patch also checkes smc->clcsock in them too. And the caller of smc_switch_to_fallback() will identify whether fallback succeeds according to the return value.",
