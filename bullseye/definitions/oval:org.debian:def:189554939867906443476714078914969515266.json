		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  SUNRPC: lock against ->sock changing during sysfs read  ->sock can be set to NULL asynchronously unless ->recv_mutex is held. So it is important to hold that mutex.  Otherwise a sysfs read can trigger an oops. Commit 17f09d3f619a (\"SUNRPC: Check if the xprt is connected before handling sysfs reads\") appears to attempt to fix this problem, but it only narrows the race window.",
