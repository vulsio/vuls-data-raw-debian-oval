		"description": "An issue was discovered in the ROS communications-related packages (aka ros_comm or ros-melodic-ros-comm) through 1.14.3. ROS_ASSERT_MSG only works when ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is defined. This leads to a problem in the remove() function in clients/roscpp/src/libros/spinner.cpp. When ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is not defined, the iterator loop will run out of the scope of the array, and cause denial of service for other components (that depend on the communication-related functions of this package). NOTE: The reporter of this issue now believes it was a false alarm.",
