		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/mediatek: Fix a null pointer crash in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip  It's possible that mtk_crtc->event is NULL in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip().  pending_needs_vblank value is set by mtk_crtc->event, but in mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's is not guarded by the same lock in mtk_drm_finish_page_flip(), thus a race condition happens.  Consider the following case:  CPU1                              CPU2 step 1: mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_begin() mtk_crtc->event is not null,                                   step 1:                                   mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush:                                   mtk_drm_crtc_update_config(                                       !!mtk_crtc->event) step 2: mtk_crtc_ddp_irq -> mtk_drm_finish_page_flip: lock mtk_crtc->event set to null, pending_needs_vblank set to false unlock                                   pending_needs_vblank set to true,                                    step 2:                                   mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->                                   mtk_drm_finish_page_flip called again,                                   pending_needs_vblank is still true                                   //null pointer  Instead of guarding the entire mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's more efficient to just check if mtk_crtc->event is null before use.",
