		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/vmwgfx: Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopy  A failing usercopy of the fence_rep object will lead to a stale entry in the file descriptor table as put_unused_fd() won't release it. This enables userland to refer to a dangling 'file' object through that still valid file descriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-free exploitation scenarios.  Fix this by deferring the call to fd_install() until after the usercopy has succeeded.",
