		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: mac80211: fix race condition on enabling fast-xmit  fast-xmit must only be enabled after the sta has been uploaded to the driver, otherwise it could end up passing the not-yet-uploaded sta via drv_tx calls to the driver, leading to potential crashes because of uninitialized drv_priv data. Add a missing sta->uploaded check and re-check fast xmit after inserting a sta.",
