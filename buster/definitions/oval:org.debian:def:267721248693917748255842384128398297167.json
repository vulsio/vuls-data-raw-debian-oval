    "description": "In the Admin Package Manager in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) 5.0.0 through 5.0.24 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.1, authenticated admins are able to exploit a Blind Remote Code Execution vulnerability by loading a crafted opm file with an embedded CodeInstall element to execute a command on the server during package installation.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue stating \"the behaviour is as designed and needed for different packages to be installed\", \"there is a security warning if the package is not verified by OTRS Group\", and \"there is the possibility and responsibility of an admin to check packages before installation which is possible as they are not binary.",
