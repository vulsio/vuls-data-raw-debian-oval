		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code  It is reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core code deadlocks, because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in that case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is already held.  Executing the argument function synchronously from within dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it may cause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a requisite supplier device's one, for example).  Address this by changing the code in question to use async_schedule_dev_nocall() for scheduling the asynchronous execution of device suspend and resume functions and to directly run them synchronously if async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.",
