		"description": "TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCEâ€™s content extraction code. When using the `noneditable_regexp` option, specially crafted HTML attributes containing malicious code were able to be executed when content was extracted from the editor. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that, when using the `noneditable_regexp` option, any content within an attribute is properly verified to match the configured regular expression before being added. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
