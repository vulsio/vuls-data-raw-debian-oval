		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/mce: Make sure to grab mce_sysfs_mutex in set_bank()  Modifying a MCA bank's MCA_CTL bits which control which error types to be reported is done over    /sys/devices/system/machinecheck/   ├── machinecheck0   │   ├── bank0   │   ├── bank1   │   ├── bank10   │   ├── bank11   ...  sysfs nodes by writing the new bit mask of events to enable.  When the write is accepted, the kernel deletes all current timers and reinits all banks.  Doing that in parallel can lead to initializing a timer which is already armed and in the timer wheel, i.e., in use already:    ODEBUG: init active (active state 0) object: ffff888063a28000 object   type: timer_list hint: mce_timer_fn+0x0/0x240 arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mce/core.c:2642   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 8120 at lib/debugobjects.c:514   debug_print_object+0x1a0/0x2a0 lib/debugobjects.c:514  Fix that by grabbing the sysfs mutex as the rest of the MCA sysfs code does.
