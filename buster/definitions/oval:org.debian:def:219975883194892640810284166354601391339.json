		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  comedi: vmk80xx: fix incomplete endpoint checking  While vmk80xx does have endpoint checking implemented, some things can fall through the cracks. Depending on the hardware model, URBs can have either bulk or interrupt type, and current version of vmk80xx_find_usb_endpoints() function does not take that fully into account. While this warning does not seem to be too harmful, at the very least it will crash systems with 'panic_on_warn' set on them.  Fix the issue found by Syzkaller [1] by somewhat simplifying the endpoint checking process with usb_find_common_endpoints() and ensuring that only expected endpoint types are present.  This patch has not been tested on real hardware.
