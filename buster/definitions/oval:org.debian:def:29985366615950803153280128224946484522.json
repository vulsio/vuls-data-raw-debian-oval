		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  netfilter: nf_tables: reject QUEUE/DROP verdict parameters  This reverts commit e0abdadcc6e1.  core.c:nf_hook_slow assumes that the upper 16 bits of NF_DROP verdicts contain a valid errno, i.e. -EPERM, -EHOSTUNREACH or similar, or 0.  Due to the reverted commit, its possible to provide a positive value, e.g. NF_ACCEPT (1), which results in use-after-free.  Its not clear to me why this commit was made.  NF_QUEUE is not used by nftables; \"queue\" rules in nftables will result in use of \"nft_queue\" expression.  If we later need to allow specifiying errno values from userspace (do not know why), this has to call NF_DROP_GETERR and check that \"err <= 0\" holds true.",
