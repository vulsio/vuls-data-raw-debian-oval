		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nilfs2: prevent kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()  Fix a bug where nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status when searching and inserting the specified block both fail inconsistently.  If this inconsistent behavior is not due to a previously fixed bug, then an unexpected race is occurring, so return a temporary error -EAGAIN instead.  This prevents callers such as __block_write_begin_int() from requesting a read into a buffer that is not mapped, which would cause the BUG_ON check for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc() to fail.",
