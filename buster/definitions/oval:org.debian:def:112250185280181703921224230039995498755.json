		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  scsi: target: core: Add TMF to tmr_list handling  An abort that is responded to by iSCSI itself is added to tmr_list but does not go to target core. A LUN_RESET that goes through tmr_list takes a refcounter on the abort and waits for completion. However, the abort will be never complete because it was not started in target core.
