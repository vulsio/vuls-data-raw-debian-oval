		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: ll_temac: platform_get_resource replaced by wrong function  The function platform_get_resource was replaced with devm_platform_ioremap_resource_byname and is called using 0 as name.  This eventually ends up in platform_get_resource_byname in the call stack, where it causes a null pointer in strcmp.  \tif (type == resource_type(r) && !strcmp(r->name, name))  It should have been replaced with devm_platform_ioremap_resource.",
