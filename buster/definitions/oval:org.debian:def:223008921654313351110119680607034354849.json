That commit introduced the following race and can cause system hung.   md_write_start:             raid5d:  // mddev->in_sync == 1  set \"MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING\"                             // running before md_write_start wakeup it                              waiting \"MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING\" cleared                              >>>>>>>>> hung  wakeup mddev->thread  ...  waiting \"MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING\" cleared  >>>> hung, raid5d should clear this flag  but get hung by same flag.  The issue reverted commit fixing is fixed by last patch in a new way.",
