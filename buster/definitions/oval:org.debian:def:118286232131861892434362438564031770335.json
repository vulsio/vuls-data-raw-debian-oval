		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  igb: Fix use-after-free error during reset  Cleans the next descriptor to watch (next_to_watch) when cleaning the TX ring.  Failure to do so can cause invalid memory accesses. If igb_poll() runs while the controller is reset this can lead to the driver try to free a skb that was already freed.  (The crash is harder to reproduce with the igb driver, but the same potential problem exists as the code is identical to igc)",
