		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nfc: nci: Fix uninit-value in nci_dev_up and nci_ntf_packet  syzbot reported the following uninit-value access issue [1][2]:  nci_rx_work() parses and processes received packet. When the payload length is zero, each message type handler reads uninitialized payload and KMSAN detects this issue. The receipt of a packet with a zero-size payload is considered unexpected, and therefore, such packets should be silently discarded.  This patch resolved this issue by checking payload size before calling each message type handler codes.",
