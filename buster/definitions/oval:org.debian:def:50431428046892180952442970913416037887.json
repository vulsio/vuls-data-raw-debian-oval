This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Exim. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of NTLM challenge requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure.
