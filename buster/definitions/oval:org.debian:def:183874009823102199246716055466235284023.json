		"description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: Fix hashtab overflow check on 32-bit arches  The hashtab code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number of hash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the resulting value is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value, which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which contains the same check, copied from the hashtab code. So apply the same fix to hashtab, by moving the overflow check to before the roundup.",
